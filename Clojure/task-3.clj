;;;; Task: Create a recursive function that finds the greatest common divisor (GCD).

;;;; the GCD of 10 and 100 is 10, since 10 goes into each with 0 left over for both.

;; two arguments - integers
;; uses modulo
;; GCD(b, a % b)

(defn hello-to [person-name] ; Defining a function
    (println (str "Hello " person-name))
    (println (str "Goodbye " person-name)))




(hello-to "joe") ; Calling a function.
